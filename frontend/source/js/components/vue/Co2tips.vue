              Suggestion - pick up as a “Step 1” up to 3 options and constantly practice them, at least, for one month in order to develop a
              good habit. After that, look for other sustainable practices to implement. Going slowly is more effective in this case,
              because when you are trying to change a lot of things in your life, you put yourself in stressful situation, which will not
              lead to successful results.

        <b-tab title="Food">
          <ul class="purple-ul ml-20">
            <li><strong class="text-purple">Eat more plants.</strong> Farming animals for meat and dairy requires space and huge amounts of water and feed. The livestock industry alone generates nearly 15% of all man-made greenhouse gas emissions. With global meat consumption soaring 500% between 1992 and 2016, it is clear we need to rebalance our diets by prioritising plants and moderating our intake of animal products.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-purple">Cut the waste.</strong> Food waste is a big problem. 30% of the food produced is wasted, with serious repercussions for the environment. In fact, if food waste was a country it would be the 3rd largest emitter of greenhouse gasses after China and the USA. Reducing waste in your household is simple: freeze anything you canâ€™t eat while itâ€™s fresh and, where possible, buy loose produce so you can select the exact amount that you need.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-purple">Grow your own food.</strong> Whatâ€™s better than fresh, home-grown produce straight from the garden? As well as being healthy and delicious, it is free from the carbon footprint of shop-bought food.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-purple">Look for products containing PSPO certified palm oil.</strong> Unsustainable palm oil is responsible for large-scale deforestation, putting wildlife like orangutans and tigers under threat, as well as contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the risk of climate change. But rejecting palm oil all together could have unintended consequences as alternatives can be even worse for the environment, with some needing up to nine times as much land to produce. When youâ€™re shopping look for products containing RSPO certified sustainable palm oil.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-purple">Pass on plastic.</strong> Plastic has infiltrated our natural world and even our diets. Bring a reusable-bag when you shop, opt for packaging-free fruit and vegetables where possible, and ask brands and retailers that continue to use plastic to find alternatives.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-purple">Eat what is in season.</strong> When possible try to include seasonal produce from your local farm shop or greengrocer in your diet. It helps the environment by cutting down on the packaging, transport and high intensity farming process needed for out of season foods. Seasonal food is also cheaper.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-purple">Add some variety.</strong> The way a food is farmed is a hugely important part of how sustainable that type of food is. Constant farming of the same crop types will drain nutrients from the soil. Then farming this crop all year long will give no time for the soil to recover. By having a colourful plate, we will be ensuring a more nutritious, natural, flavourful and exciting meal - one that is in sync with your ecosystem.</li>
          </ul>

        <b-tab title="Water">
          <ul class="purple-ul ml-20">
            <li><strong class="text-purple">Switch to showers.</strong> Switching from baths to showers is an easy way to save water. If youâ€™re already a shower person, then try keeping your shower to 4 minutes or less. Lots of water companies will send you a shower timer for free â€“ check with your provider to find out.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-purple">Fill up the kettle only as much as you need.</strong> Filling up the kettle only as much as you need saves both water and energy, and most kettles have indicators letting you know how much water you need for each cup.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-purple">Turn off the tap.</strong> Running taps waste as much as 6 litres of water a minute, so try filling a bowl of water when rinsing vegetables or fruit to keep your veg clean and your water use low!</li>
            <li><strong class="text-purple">Make sure your dishwasher is full.</strong> Switching from handwashing to dishwashing saves 6000L a year â€“ and not pre-rinsing your dishes before they go in saves another 1000L every year.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-purple">Use leftover cooking water</strong> or water from rinsing your veg â€“ to water your plants or use on the garden.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-purple">Fixing leaky taps is an easy fix to reducing your water footprint.</strong> Check your taps for any leaks under the sink, or for any drips when the tap is fully off. Lots of water companies also give away free â€˜leak stripsâ€™ which stick to the toilet bowl and change colour if your toilet is leaking water.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-purple">Fit flow aerators on your taps and showers.</strong> These cheap adaptors to your taps aerate your water supply, which means that you get the same water pressure but use much less water!</li>
            <li><strong class="text-purple">Keep the sprinklers off.</strong> If you have a garden then remember to keep the sprinklers off! Thereâ€™s lots of ways to water your garden without them â€“ invest in a water butt that collects water throughout the year for you to use, or try using cooking water instead. Your plants will benefit from the extra nutrients!</li>

        <b-tab title="Household and energy">
          <ul class="purple-ul ml-20">
            <li><strong class="text-purple">Turn down the heating by 1°</strong>, it will already make a difference</li>
            <li><strong class="text-purple">Unplug the devices.</strong> Unplug your electronic equipment and donâ€™t leave your phone on charge when the battery is already full</li>
            <li><strong class="text-purple">Select energy efficient products</strong> with an "A" label</li>
            <li><strong class="text-purple">Lighting.</strong> Turn off lights youâ€™re not using and when you leave the room. Replace incandescent light bulbs with compact flourescent or LED ones.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-purple">Thermostat.</strong> Donâ€™t set it too high or low. Install a programmable model to turn off the heat/air conditioning when youâ€™re not home.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-purple">Limit and recycle your waste.</strong></li>

        </b-tab>
        <b-tab title="Transport">
          <ul class="purple-ul ml-20">
            <li><strong class="text-purple">Carpool.</strong> Are there times you could carpool with others to drive less? Although this might require more time and planning, it can save large amounts of gasoline, especially for long trips. Determine if you regularly drive to the same place as neighbors or people who live along the way. In addition to creating time to socialize, carpooling saves gasoline and wear and tear on the car.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-purple">Combine trips.</strong> When you run errands, think ahead to minimize driving. What trips can be combined? Even if you donâ€™t cut the miles that you drive by combining trips, operating a car with a hot motor has better fuel economy than a cool car, especially in colder weather.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-purple">Walk, Jog or Bike.</strong> There are many fun ways to get around town that donâ€™t include burning fossil fuels. Whenever possible, roll, stroll or glide during your commute. Itâ€™s also a great way to get some exercise and stay in shape.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-purple">Drive an Electric Vehicle.</strong> If you do own a car, electric vehicles are a cleaner and greener option than gasoline-powered cars. With no tailpipe emissions, they prevent air pollution and cut fossil fuel use. Electric vehicles, followed by hybrid vehicles, have lower carbon emissions than gasoline-powered cars.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-purple">Use fuel-efficient vehicles.</strong> If you are unable to go electric or even car-free, drive one of the most fuel-efficient cars within its class. Through this simple purchasing decision, you will use less gas and save more cash throughout the life of the vehicle.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-purple">Take public transport.</strong> Public transport is a great alternative to driving and will reduce your carbon footprint dramatically. By taking the train or bus, it means fewer cars on the road overall, resulting in less carbon dioxide being produced. And the cars that remain would have quicker journeys due to decreased congestion on the roads, again resulting in a CO2 reduction. It will also give you added time to read or listen to music on your journey.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-purple">Air travel â€“ use the direct flights.</strong> Jet fuel is a high-carbon energy source, and take-off and landing are the most fuel-intensive parts of a flight, so the more connections you make, the higher your carbon footprint. You can reduce your impact by avoiding connecting flights when you book your flight.</li>
          </ul>

        <b-tab title="Other practices">
          <p class="no-margin">
            <strong class="text-purple">Clothing</strong>
          </p>
          <ul class="purple-ul ml-20">
            <li>Take good care of your clothes</li>
            <li>Try swapping, borrowing, renting or buying second-hand</li>
            <li>Buy responsibly-made clothes, e.g. made from recycled material or with an eco-label</li>
            <li>Buy one expensive thing. We live in a culture of disposable fashion which is taking its toll on the environment. Buy one well-made expensive item of clothing rather than constantly replacing it with cheaper alternatives. This will stop the waste of resources in manufacturing, it also cuts down the transport costs and carbon cost of the supply chain too. Less clothes being transported means less emissions and trucks on the road.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="no-margin">
            <strong class="text-purple">Reuse</strong>
          </p>
          <p class="no-margin">
            Reusing items â€“ by repairing, donating, or selling them â€“ also reduces waste. Reusing products, when possible, is even better than recycling because the item does not need to be reprocessed before it can be used again. Many items lose their original usefulness, but can take on a new life, like turning old clothes into rags. Youâ€™ll also save money by not buying new. Large and reusable items sent to landfills take up valuable space and take year to break down. Instead of contributing landfilling waste, donate the item to a charity. Tips to help you reuse items:
          </p>
          <ul class="purple-ul ml-20">
            <li>Sell & shop at consignments: Selling at consignment stores or yard sales earns you spare cash and allows others to reuse your unwanted items. Youâ€™ll also save when shopping second-hand because items often cost a third-less than new items.</li>
            <li>Use reusables: Food utensils, disposable cups, and other throwaways contribute a large percentage to waste. Using a personal coffee mug or lunch container can help cut down throwaway waste.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="no-margin">
            <strong class="text-purple">Recycle</strong>
          </p>
          <p class="no-margin">
            Recycling has numerous environmental benefits so sorting your trash is worth the effort! Ways recycling helps:
          </p>
          <ul class="purple-ul ml-20">
            <li>Recycling can reduce the cost of waste disposal: Trash collection doesnâ€™t come without a price tag. Garbage trucks must pay to dump their waste at a landfill. Recycling reduces landfill costs because less waste is landfilled.</li>
            <li>Recycling can save energy: It almost always takes less energy to make a product from recycled materials than it does to make it from new materials. In fact, recycling aluminum is 90-95 percent more energy efficient than producing aluminum from raw materials. Recycling glass requires up to 26 percent less energy than using virgin materials.</li>
            <li>Recycling saves natural resources: Natural resources include land, plants, minerals, and water. By reusing materials more than once, we reduce demands for raw materials and avoid additional natural resource degradation.</li>
            <li>Recycling can reduce pollution: When waste ends up as litter, it contributes to wildlife poisoning, entanglement and death, and unsightly vistas of trash-strewn roads, waterways and parks. Plastic waste is particularly problematic. According to recent research, the worldâ€™s oceans are filled with at least 260,000 tons of floating plastic particles.</li>
            <li>Recycling creates jobs: Example from USA - Recycling and waste management jobs employ close to 400,000 Americans today. Recycle Across America reports that if recycling levels reach 75 percent it would support 1.5 million jobs in the United States only.</li>
          </ul>

        <b-tab title="Plastic free challenge">
          <p>
            In any conversation about living more sustainably, reducing the amount of plastic we use is usually one of the first things mentioned – and for good reason; we use a lot of plastic that can severely damage the environment. We challenge you to become aware of the plastic you use in your everyday life. We mean the plastic packaging on your groceries, or take-away coffee cups. Your shower gel, face cleanser or shampoo can also contain microplastics.

            Re-using coffee cups, or taking a bag to the grocery store are actions that fight plastic pollution. But this is not our only concern. The following article takes a different perspective and states that the focus on reducing plastic distracts from more serious problems such as climate change and rising sea levels.
